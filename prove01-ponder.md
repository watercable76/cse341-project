## Prove01 Ponder

After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/watercable76/cse341-project)

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.  
  Routes are all working. User is able to type in a username and store the name in the  
  users route. Added a placeholder for the input.  

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.  
  All parts are working correctly.  

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.  
  The cooolest thing I learned was how to read and write from a file. I tried to save the  
  user input to a new file, but could not get it to be ready correctly, and I found another  
  way to save the input. It was still cool to realize I could read from a file, and that meant  
  I could also write to a file. It was cool to learn about all of that.  

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?  
  I would make sure the rubrics are the same for the canvas page and the github page. I do not  
  know which is supposed to be the actual rubric, but that's it.  

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:  
   1 - Some attempt was made  
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient  
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate  
   4 - Meets requirements  
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements  
   * I earned a 5 on this assignment.  

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.  
  I used loops to read data for the list of people. I also set this list to grow as long  
  as the user did not exit the site. I also added a placeholder for the input and used multi-line  
  strings for writing the html files with node.js.
